            <p>CHUM is a democratic, egalitarian organization where any member of the College Park community may pay dues or, alternatively, attend a certain number of consecutive meetings, and receive one vote in the decisions the organization makes.</p>
            <p>CHUM has a Board of Directors elected annually from within its dues-paying membership, but input from the entire community is welcome at board meetings and in board decisions. CHUM also has a number of volunteer committees open to all members
              of the community, dues-paying or otherwise, who are interested in cooperative living.</p>

          <p>The finance committee is involved in collecting rent, utility, and membership dues from CHUM members every month. There is a representative from every house and they have meetings twice a month to discuss expenses and to draft an annual budget.
            Any expenses made from the CHUM account are to be discussed primarily in finance committee meetings and then brought to the attention of the membership at a general body meeting.</p>

      <p>This committee connects CHUM members with the community by maintaining a free garden for the community to utilize. Its mission is to foster community engagement by having Seeding Days where CHUM members and community members
        can plant crops together, as well as provide a sustainable source of herbs and vegetables.</p>
        <p>The sustainability committee is involved in reducing water and energy consumption, and waste production of the houses in the coop. This serves not only to reduce utility expenses for the membership, but also to reduce CHUM's environmental footprint.</p>
    <p>The sustainability committee is responsible for the creation of the CHUM garden, as well as our compost collection system. The compost is used to fertilize the CHUM gardens in the Spring. The gardens are also watered with a rain barrel that was constructed in 2014.</p>
    <p>In the future, the committee plans to collaborate with the Zine committee to write a handbook for all the members on strategies to reduce individual and house environental impacts.</p>

    <p>The zine committee aims to create fun and informative booklets with information about sustainable practices, cooperative principles, housing and social justice, and other issues relevant to the organization.</p>
    <p>Zine committee works to advcate for healthy, sustainable living as well as promoting activism among College Park citizens. It discusses issues ranging from social justice, politics, harm reduction, and other issues. It is in many ways the voice
      of CHUM artists, writers, and activists.</p>
    <p>Past Disorientation Guides and zine publications are currently housed in the CHUM library at Flamingo Paradise and are open for public viewing at any time.</p>

      the material if knowledgeable, and contacting appropriate committees to request information if they are not. The Outreach and Organization Committee will work closely with the website committee to develop content, disseminate information and
      make documents accessible to all CHUM members and appropriate parties. (For example our flyers would be publicly accessible, but our contact lists would be given member-only access.) Ideally, New Membership would also have a symbiotic relationship
      with this committee.</p>
